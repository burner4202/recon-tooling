		<h4>Reactions Example</h4>
		<br />
		<h4>Preamble</h4>
		<p>
			In this example, we are going to search the indexes for a lowsec systems with a high reaction index.<br /><br />
			At the time of writing 6th of August 2019, 1DQ-1 has an index of 17.6%, to give you an idea of reaction output.<br /><br />

			Siseide will be used for this example a 0.34 low sec system, which up until 2 weeks ago had an index of 18.1%.<br /><br />
			Therefore Siseide had a higher output in moon reactions than 1DQ-1.<br /><br />

			With this in mind, we are able to use GSF Recon Tools to find a T2 rigged Tatara in this system.<br />
		</p>
		<br />

		<h4>Explanation</h4>
		<p>
			We found this system based on sorting the lowsec indexes as detailed and shown on the summary tab.<br /><br />
			As detailed on Fig 1, at the point of the red arrow, the index dropped, why?<br /><br />
			What happened? If we check the killboards we find Fig 2.<br /><br />
			From that point onwards, the indexes in this system have continued to drop.<br />
		</p>
		<br />

		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<p>
			GSF Recon was used to identify:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>A system with high reactions.</li>
				<li>Upwell Structure used for reactions</li>
				<li>T2 Rigged Tatara</li>
				<li>Structure Death</li>
			</ul>
